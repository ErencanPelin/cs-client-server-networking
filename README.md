# Client/Multi-Client and Server Networking configuration in C# MVVM WPF
A Multi-client-server networking system built on top of Payload's YouTube videos, added some extra events and functionalities along with encryption and proper error handling. Thanks to Payload for the project base! :D

Both client and server use symmetric key encryption using the AES encryption algorithm to encrypt all messages and data transmissions

Private and public Keys are calculated via ECDH (Elliptic-curve Diffieâ€“Hellman) and exchanged via port 443 TLS (transport layer security) to ensure a secure key exchange between the client and server
